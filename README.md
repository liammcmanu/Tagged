# Tagged - Your AI-Powered File Organizer

## Description

Tagged is a Google Chrome extension that revolutionizes the way you search and organize your files in Google Drive. Using advanced AI technology, Tagged allows you to search through your files based on their content, not just their file names.

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tagged.git`
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
5. Select the directory to which you cloned the repository.

## Usage

After installing the extension, you can start using it by clicking on the Tagged icon in your Chrome toolbar. This will open a side panel where after signing-in you can search for images in your Google Drive.

To search for an image, simply type a description of the image into the search bar. For example, if you're looking for a picture of a beach, you could type "beach" and the AI will return all images that it identifies as containing a beach.
